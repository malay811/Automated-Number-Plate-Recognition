# Automated-Number-Plate-Recognition
This repository implements a hardware-software pipeline using a YOLO detector and Tesseract OCR to identify and extract numeric license plate digits. The extracted data is transmitted over UART to a Nexys A7 FPGA, which decodes the input and visualizes the results on multiplexed seven-segment displays.
